Todo
----
- check if shorewall compiles without errors, otherwise fail !

Configuration
-------------

If you need to install a specific version of shorewall other than
the default one that would be installed by 'ensure => present', then
you can set the following variable and that specific version will be
installed instead:

    $shorewall_ensure_version = "4.0.15-1"

Torify
------

The shorewall::rules::torify define can be used to force some outgoing
TCP traffic through the Tor transparent proxy. The corresponding
non-TCP traffic is rejected accordingly.

Beware! This define only is part of a torified setup. DNS requests and
IPv6, amongst others, might leak network activity you would prefer not
to. You really need to read proper documentation about these matters
before using this feature e.g.:

  https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en#warning

The Tor transparent proxy location defaults to 127.0.0.1:9040 and can
be configured by setting the $tor_transparent_proxy_host and
$tor_transparent_proxy_port variables before including the main
shorewall class.

Example usage follows.

Torify any outgoing TCP traffic originating from user bob or alice and
aimed at 6.6.6.6 or 7.7.7.7:

  shorewall::rules::torify {
    'torify-some-bits':
      users        => [ 'bob', 'alice' ],
      destinations => [ '6.6.6.6', '7.7.7.7' ];
  }

Torify any outgoing TCP traffic to 8.8.8.8:

  shorewall::rules::torify {
    'torify-to-this-host':
      destinations  => [ '8.8.8.8' ];
  }

When no destination nor user is provided any outgoing TCP traffic (see
restrictions bellow) is torified. In that case the user running the
Tor client ($tor_user) is whitelisted; this variable defaults to
"debian-tor" on Debian systems and to "tor" on others. if this does
not suit your configuration you need to set the $tor_user variable
before including the main shorewall class.

When no destination is provided traffic directed to RFC1918 addresses
is by default allowed and (obviously) not torified. This behaviour can
be changed by setting the allow_rfc1918 parameter to false.

Torify any outgoing TCP traffic but connections to RFC1918 addresses:

  shorewall::rules::torify {
    'torify-everything-but-lan':
  }

Torify any outgoing TCP traffic:

  shorewall::rules::torify {
    'torify-everything:
      allow_rfc1918 => false;
  }

In some cases (e.g. when providing no specific destination nor user
and denying access to RFC1918 addresses) UDP DNS requests may be
rejected. This is intentional: it does not make sense leaking -via DNS
requests- network activity that would otherwise be torified. In that
case you probably want to read proper documentation about such
matters, enable the Tor DNS resolver and redirect DNS requests through
it,

either globally:

  shorewall::rules::torify::redirect_dns_to_tor { '-': }

or for specific users:

  shorewall::rules::torify::redirect_dns_to_tor { ['bob', 'alice' ]: }

The $tor_dns_host and $tor_dns_port variables must be set before
these defines are setup.

Example
-------

Example from node.pp:

node xy {
	$shorewall_startup="0"  # create shorewall ruleset but don't startup
	include config::site-shorewall
	shorewall::rule {
		'incoming-ssh': source => 'all', destination => '$FW',  action  => 'SSH(ACCEPT)', order => 200;
		'incoming-puppetmaster': source => 'all', destination => '$FW',  action  => 'Puppetmaster(ACCEPT)', order => 300;
		'incoming-imap': source => 'all', destination => '$FW',  action  => 'IMAP(ACCEPT)', order => 300;
		'incoming-smtp': source => 'all', destination => '$FW',  action  => 'SMTP(ACCEPT)', order => 300;
	}
}


class config::site-shorewall {
        include shorewall

	# If you want logging:
        #shorewall::params {
        #       'LOG':            value => 'debug';
        #	'MAILSERVER':     value => $shorewall_mailserver;
        #}

        shorewall::zone {'net':
                type => 'ipv4';
        }

        shorewall::rule_section { 'NEW':
                order => 10;
        }

        case $shorewall_rfc1918_maineth {
                '': {$shorewall_rfc1918_maineth = true }
        }

        case $shorewall_main_interface {
                '': { $shorewall_main_interface = 'eth0' }
        }

        shorewall::interface {"$shorewall_main_interface":
                zone    => 'net',
                rfc1918  => $shorewall_rfc1918_maineth,
                options => 'tcpflags,blacklist,nosmurfs';
        }

                order                   =>      110;
                'net-to-fw':

                order                   =>      120;
        }       

        
        # default Rules : ICMP 
        shorewall::rule { 'allicmp-to-host': source => 'all', destination => '$FW', order  => 200, action  => 'AllowICMPs(ACCEPT)';
