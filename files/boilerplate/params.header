# Shorewall version 3.4 - Params File
#
# /etc/shorewall/params
#
#       Assign any variables that you need here.
#
#       It is suggested that variable names begin with an upper case letter
#       to distinguish them from variables used internally within the
#       Shorewall programs
#
#       Example:
#
#               NET_IF=eth0
#               NET_BCAST=130.252.100.255
#               NET_OPTIONS=routefilter,norfc1918
#
#       Example (/etc/shorewall/interfaces record):
#
#               net     $NET_IF         $NET_BCAST      $NET_OPTIONS
#
#       The result will be the same as if the record had been written
#
#               net     eth0            130.252.100.255 routefilter,norfc1918
